# NextJS Basics 
A continuation of the PGP-NextJS-Basics repo (https://github.com/Khabazbashi/PGP-NextJS-Basics) where a simple application was created in Next that listed products from a local data file. 

In this project, server side rendering is used to retrieve the data from Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) in two different ways - serverSideProps and getStaticProps. 

The user can filter the products by category or by entering text in the search field. Each product has a details page where additional information about the product can be viewed.



## Try it out
- Clone the repo
- `npm ci`
- `npm run dev`
- Path: "/products"
